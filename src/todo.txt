TODO: 03.21.2025
-- Move term into it's own file and all it's little helpers
-- Implement exterior product and regressive products (big day!)
-- Make the node_id default to -1 and make it a signed type

-- Implement scalar multiplication so we have a1*e1 + a2*e2

Done:
xxx--Rename 'bits' to bitset (sounds more professional)
xxx--Reorder the build files in alphabetical order.
