TODO: 03.21.2025
-- Add semantic check that we take scalar multiplication where at least one element is a scalar.
-- v = a1*e1 is crashing for unrecognized node to try and clone!
-- Implement addition and subtraction with the lookup stuff
-- Do the update to the symbol table
-- Need to get back to commands and how those are handled as well. Always something! (dir and pos()) in particular then we can do the projection formulas!



Done:
xxx--Rename 'bits' to bitset (sounds more professional)
xxx--Reorder the build files in alphabetical order.
xxx--Move term into it's own file and all it's little helpers
xxx-- Implement exterior product and regressive products (big day!)
xxx-- Clean up term-to-string, so messy looking
xxx-- Implement scalar multiplication so we have a1*e1 + a2*e2
